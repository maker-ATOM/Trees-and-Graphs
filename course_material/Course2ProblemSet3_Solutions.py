# ## 2A: Use union-find data-structures to compute strongly connected components.
# We have previously seen  how to use DFS to find maximal strongly connected components with a small twist.
# 
#   - We will consider only those edges $(i,j)$ whose weights are less than or equal to a threshold $W$ provided by the user.
#   - Edges with weights above this threshold are not considered.
#   
# Design an algorithm to compute all the maximal strongly connected components for all eeges with threshold $W$ using the union-find data structure. What is the running time of your algorithm. Note that this is manually graded answer : you can compare your solution against our solution provided at the end of this assignment.

# ## 2C: Edge Threshold to Disconnect a Graph
# 
# Let $G$ be a weighted undirected graph that is strongly connected (i.e, the entire graph itself is an SCC). Our goal is to find a largest weight $W$ such that removing all edges of weight $\geq W$ will disconnect the graph.
# 
# Prove that the threshold $W$ is equal to the largest weight edge in the MST found by Kruskal's algorithm by proving that:
#   - Removing all edges of weight  $\geq W$  will result in a disconnected graph.
#   - Keeping just  edges of weight $\leq W$ (or removing edges of weight $> W$) will result in a connected graph.
# 
# 
# Use the fact that a graph is strongly connected if and only if it has a minimum spanning tree. 

# YOUR ANSWER HERE

# ## Topological Data Analysis on Images (Not part of the Assignment -- just in case you are curious).
# 
# We illustrate an interesting connection between the graph algorithms for strongly connected components and minimum spanning trees to analyze images. Specifically, we will identify components in images as follows.
# 
# a) First, we treat an image stored as a `.png` or `.jpg` file as a matrix of pixels where pixels have color and intensity.
# 
# b) Given an image, we build a graph whose vertices are pixes and edges connect neighboring pixels.
# 
# c) The edge weight of an edge in the graph connecting neighboring pixels measures the intensity difference between the pixels (other measures of local pixel differences could also be used).
# 
# 
# We can perform the following analysis (this is just an example of this kind of analysis which belongs to a larger family of methods called topological data analysis).
# 
# 
# (a) Build a minimum spanning tree and compute the maximum weight edge in the MST. Let us call it W.
# 
# (b) Consider the maximal strongly connected components of the image for various thresholds such as $0.5W$, $0.75W$ or $0.9W$. Visualizing the pixels in various strongly connected components will allow us to study the "segments" that make up the images.
