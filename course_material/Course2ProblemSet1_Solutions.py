# # Part 1: Implement Binary Search Tree 
# 
# We will begin by implementing binary search tree data structure in python. Please read the descriptions of functions carefully and complete them according to description. You should be familiar with objects in python. There are many tutorials online that you can use for this : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm

# # Part 2: Height of Random Binary Search Trees
# 
# The height of a binary search tree depends on the order in which we insert the keys of the tree. In this problem, we investigate a curious link between the recursion depth of quicksort algorithm on an array of n elements and the depth of binary search trees.
# 
# Suppose we wish to insert keys the set of keys from $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ into a binary search tree. Answer the questions below.

# ### 2(A)
# Provide examples of insertion sequences such that the resulting tree will have the worst possible  height of $n$. Note that the answer below will not be graded but you are encouraged to solve it and compare with the solutions.

# 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1

# ### 2(B) 
# Let `s1,...,sj` be a sequence of $j \geq 1$ keys inserted, wherein each `si` is a number between `0` and `n-1` and each number in the sequence is unique.
# 
# Prove that if the sequence yields a tree of height `j` (worst possible case) then `s1` must be the minimum or maximum element in the sequence. 
# 
# **Hint:** Proof by contradiction will work. First note that `s1` will be the root of the tree obtained. Show that if `s1` is not the minimum or maximum then the resulting tree will have height < `n-1`). Note that the answer below will not be graded but you are encouraged to solve it and compare with the solutions.

# YOUR ANSWER HERE

# ### 2(C)
# Using the implementation of the binary search tree in part 1, complete the function `calculateAverageDepth(n, numTrials)` that performs the following experiment `numTrials` number of times.
# 
# Each experiment run is as follows:
# 
# - Take a list of numbers from 0 to n-1.
# - Randomly shuffle the list: use random.shuffle function or (advanced) write your own shuffle.
# - Insert the randomly shuffled list into a tree.
# - Find and return the depth of the tree.
# 
# Finally, we run the experiment above `numTrials` times and take the average of all the trials.
# 
# We then plot the average depth of a random binary search tree as a function of n.

# The histograms and plots should show an amazing fact that although the worst case depth can be as large as $n$, the depth of a random binary search tree is concentrated between $1.8\log_2(n)$ and $2.2 \log_2(n)$.
# 
# This is interesting since if we can ensure that the keys are inserted at random, a BST can be quite well balanced with very high probability. There are many clever ideas on how this can be achieved in practice even if the user does not insert keys randomly. One way is called _treaps_, which we sometimes present in this class but decided to leave out for the coursera data-structures class. You can watch the treaps lecture here:

# ## Solutions to Manually Graded Problems

# ### 2(A)
# 
# Examples of worst case sequences include inserting in 
# ascending order [0,1,...,n-1] or descending order [0,1,...,n-1].
# 
# 
# ### 2(B)
# 
# Assuming for the sake of contradition that s1 is not the least or maximum element. However, s1 will be the root of the tree. Then there must exist a non-zero number of elements that are in the left subtree of s1 and a non-zero number of elements in the right subtree. Therefore, the maximum size of any path from root to leaf must be strictly less than j. However, the height of the tree is j. Therefore, we obtain a contradiction.
