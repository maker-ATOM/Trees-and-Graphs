# ## Problem 1: Program DFS for Undirected Graph Data Structure
# 
# We will now program an undirected graph using the adjacency list representation in Python along with some utility functions including a depth first search algorithm over undirected graphs. 
# 
# Recall that a graph is undirected if for every edge $(u,v)$ in the graph from $u$ to $v$ there is also the edge in the reverse direction  $(v,u)$ from $v$ to $u$.

# ## 1A 
# 
# Run through DFS for the example graph below.
# 
# ![image.png](attachment:image.png)
# 
# Assume that the DFS visit starts from the node 0. Assume adjacent nodes are visited in 
# ascending order of node IDs.
# 
# (a) Write down the order in which the nodes are visited.
# 
# (b) Complete the table of discovery and finish times for each node.
# 
# (c) For each node write down its parent node in the DFS tree. Recall that if DFS discovers node j from node i, then the parent of j in the DFS tree is i. Draw the DFS tree.
# 
# (d) What are the back edges discovered by DFS? Disregard all trivial back edges $(i,j)$ where $j$ is a parent of node i in the DFS tree.
# 
# Please note that this problem will not be graded. You are encouraged to compare your answers with our solutions.

# YOUR ANSWER HERE

# ### 1 B
# 
# Complete the code for the `dfs_visit` function below. 
# 
# To do so, please read the rest of the code provided and the surrounding comments very  carefully. 
# 
# Please ensure that the following rules are followed:
# 
# - When visiting a node i, consider the set of adjacent nodes in increasing order.
#   - This is automatically done for you when you get `self.adj_list[i]` which is implemented as a python set.
# - Use the `DFSTimeCounter` class provided to keep track of DFS time.
# - The timer should be incremented just before we return from `dfs_visit` and record the finish time for a node.
# - Recall that a back edge in a DFS is encountered whenever we visit a node i and   encounter adjacent node j such that j has been discovered but not finished.
#   - If this happens, add (i,j) to the set of back edges.
#   
# The `dfs_visit` code does not return anything but updates the arguments `discovery_times`, `finish_times`, `dfs_tree_parent` and `dfs_back_edges` in place.

# Find the number of (maximal) strongly connected components in an undirected graph from the results of a DFS. Implement the function `num_connected_components` that takes in a graph `g` and returns a number that indicates the number of MSCCs in the directed graph.
# 
# #### Example
# 
# Consider the graph below 
# 
# ![image.png](attachment:image.png)
# 
# It has 3 maximal strongly connected components that have vertices $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$, 
# $\{5,6\}$ and $\{7\}$, respectively. Given such a graph, your function must return the number 3.

# **Hint** Examine  the `dfs_traverse_graph` function carefully. How do you distinguish different connected components in a graph from the DFS tree?

# We now wish to find the set of all nodes in the graph that belong to some cycle.
# 
# ###  Example
# 
# Consider the example below:
# ![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)
# 
# Nodes $\{0, 2, 3, 4\}$ lie on some cycle: example node 4 lies on many cycles one such cycle being $2-3-4$. whereas the other nodes do not.
# 
# __Note__ We do _not_ treat undirected edges as cycles although in our data structure, when an undirected edge $(i,j)$ is represented as two "directed" edges $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$, it gives the impression that they are in a cycle of length 2.
# 
# Complete the function `find_all_nodes_in_cycle` that given a graph returns a python set of nodes in a cycle.
# 
# **Hint** Perform a DFS traversal and for each _non trivial_ back edge discovered, use the DFS tree to figure out the nodes that must be on the cycle corresponding to that back edge.

# ## Solution to Problem 1 (A)
# 
# DFS works as follows
#  - Start at node 0 (time 0)
#  - Discover node 1 (time 1)
#  - Finish node 1 (time 2)
#  - Discover node 2 (time 3)
#  - Discover node 3 (time 4)
#  - Discover node 4 (time 5)
#  - Finish node 4 (time 6)
#  - Finish node 3 (time 7)
#  - Finish node 2 (time 8)
#  - Finish node 0 (time 9)
#  
# The table of discovery and finish times are 
# 
# - Node 0 - discovery : 0 finish: 9
# - Node 1 - discovery : 1 finish : 2
# - Node 2 - discovery: 3 finish: 8
# - Node 3 - discovery: 4 finish 7
# - Node 4 - discovery: 5 finish 6
# 
# The parents are
# 
# - Node 0 -- None (root node)
# - Node 1 -- 0
# - Node 2 -- 0
# - Node 3 -- 2
# - Node 4 -- 3
# 
# The back edges discovered are : (4,2) and (4,0)
