# # Solving Image Maze (With Solution)
# 
# Given a maze as an image with a start and end point, we would like to write code to solve the maze. 
# 
# An image is a 2D matrix of pixels of a particular size that depends on its resolution. Each 
# pixel has a color which is given by its Red, Green and Blue (RGB) values.
#  
# Given an image, we will view it as a graph where each pixel of the image is a vertex 
# and edges connect a pixel to its neighbor. The weight of an edge should be very small if
# the pixel colors are similar (i.e, the differences between r, g and b values are close to zero)
# and correspondingly large as the pixel colors diverge.
#   
# Next, given a source pixel $(i_0, j_0)$ and destination pixel, 
# $(i_1, j_1)$, we wish find the shortest weight path from source to destination.
# 
# You should use the Dijkstra's algorithm modified in two ways:
#    - It can exit as soon as the destination is reached.
#    - A 1000 x 1000 pixel image gives rise to a graph with million vertices. Storing such a graph as an adjacency list is going to be very memory intensive. Instead, your goal will be to generate the vertices and edges *on-the-fly*.
#    
# We will use opencv library, a popular computer vision library to load, and manipulate images of mazes.
# 
# 

# ## Manipulating Images
# 
# You can directly manipulate images in python in many ways. The `opencv` library is considered a standard for numerous
# image manipulation tasks.
# 
# Here we load an image `maze.png` and you can see it nicely plotted with coordinates. We then show you two pixels
# shown in red and blue. The goal here is to detect a path from one of the colored circle to the other, in the maze without crossing
# the black pixels.

import cv2
# You can read png, jpg and other file types 
img = cv2.imread('maze.png') # read an image from a file using opencv (cv2) library
# you can annotate images 
cv2.circle(img,(5,220), 3, (255,0,0), -1) # add a circle centered at (5, 220) radius 3, color red (RGB: 255,0,0)

# Given an image it is simple to read the color at a pixel. Let us read the color at pixel (645, 67)

px1 = img[18, 80] # It is important to note that rows of the image are y values and columns are x values.
print(px1)
px2 = img[80, 18] # This is important to note that indexing the img data structure takes y, x values.
# Most opencv functions will require (x,y) coordinates for pixel as is natural.
print(px2)


# The pixel color is expressed in RGB format. R is the red value from 0 -> 255, G is the green value 0 -> 255 and B is the blue value from 0 -> 255 
# 
# We will now define a edge weight function for an edge in the image

import math 
def fixPixelValues(px):
    # convert the RGB values into floating point to avoid an overflow that will give me wrong answers
    return [ float(px[0]), float(px[1]), float(px[2]) ]


    
# This is a useful function that given a list of (x,y) values, 
# draw a series of red lines between each coordinate and next to 
# show the path in the image

        x0, y0 = x,y

# ## Step 1: Compute Single Source Shortest Path For an Image
# 
# Given an image, compute the  shortest path between source and destination pixels by modifying Dijkstra's algorithm. __Your challenge  is to implement it without needing to create the entire the adjacency list for the graph
# in the first place. However, for simplicity you can try a first cut implementation of a generic Dijkstra algorithm over
# graphs represented as adjacency matrix or list.__

# Using Dijkstra's algorithm and the classes provided above, implement the function
# `computeShortestPath`. Its inputs are
#   - `graph` : an instance of DirectedGraphFromImage class
#   - `source_coordinates`: The (i,j) coordinates of the starting point.
#   - `dest_coordinates`: The (i,j) coordinates of the destination. 
#   
# It must return a tuple `(path, distance)` wherein 
#   - `path` is a list of pixel coordinates `[(i0,j0),...., (ik,jk)]` wherein `(i0,j0)` corresponds to the `soure_coordinates` and `(ik,jk))` corresponds to the destination.
#   - `distance` is the total weight of the shortest path.
#   
#  ## Pseudocode 
#  Here is an outline of Dijkstra's algorithm with modifications that may be useful.
#  
#  ~~~
#  1. Initialize an empty priority queue `q` (use `PriorityQueue` class)
#  2. Get the source vertex (`source`) using the function `graph.get_vertex_from_coords(i,j)`.
#  3. Set the `source.d` field to 0 to indicate that distance of source from source is 0.
#  4. Add the source vertex to the priority queue (use `insert` method).
#  5. While the priority queue is not empty.
#     5.1 Get the vertex with minimum value of d and delete it (use `get_and_delete_min` function). Let's call this vertex `u`.
#     5.2 Set the processed field of `u` to True.
#     5.3 If `u` has the same coordinates as destination (use `u.x` and `u.y`) then 
#         5.3.1 shortest path distance is `u.d` and break from the loop.
#     5.4 For each outgoing edge from `u` to `v` with weight `w`
#         5.4.1 If `v` is not already processed and `v.d > u.d + w` then 
#               5.4.1.1 update `v.d` to `u.d + w`. Set `v.pi` to `u`.
#               5.4.1.2 If `v` is already not in the priority queue, insert it into the queue
#               5.4.1.3 Else, use the `update_vertex_weight` method of priority queue with `v` as the argument to make sure that `v` is moved to the appropriate place in the priority queue.
#  6. To get the path, start from the destination vertex and keep taking the parent pointer until we reach the source. Store the sequence of vertices in a path.
#  7. Return the (path, shortest path distance)
